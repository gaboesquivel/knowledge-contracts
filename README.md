This repository contains all Ethereum Smart Contracts used at Knowledge.

Truffle is our development, testing and deployment framework.  
OpenZeppelin is the solidity library we use for writing secure Smart Contracts on Ethereum.  
We follow the [Knowledge Project Guidelines](https://knowledge.github.io/knowledge-project-guidelines/) and [Consensys Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices).

### Knowledge Token Sale

The Knowledge Token Sale starts on January 15, 2018 and it ends April 8th at 12pm. For more information visit [knowledge.io](https://knowledge.io) or join the [Knowledge Token Channel on Telegram](https://t.me/knowledgeio) where we'll be happy to discuss any questions you may have about our platform.

- External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

## Contracts

All ethereum solidity smart contracts can be found in the `/contracts` directory.

- *Knowledge.sol*  is the ERC20 Token contract for the KNW token. It's an upgradable contract, which means that if we ever discover a security vulnerability or have the need to publish a another version of the token contract users will be able to migrate their tokens to the new contract version.
- *Upgradable.sol* is the upgradable interface used by Knowledge token, it's inspired by Lunyr and Civic token contract.
- *Payment.sol* is used to receive payments at the Knowledge Marketplace and Adviser Self Service Platform.
- *Migration.sol* is a standard truffle contract needed for truffle integration and contract lifecycle management, not meant for use by Knowledge users.


## Getting Started

For you to able to understand and execute the code in this repository advanced knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js and Ethereum is required. If you are not familiar with these technologies we suggest you to visit [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/) and [learnnode.com](https://learnnode.com/).

To get started with smart contract programming with Solidity you can find an introduction to the language in the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org). In the documentation, you can find [code examples](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html) as well as [a reference](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-in-depth.html) of the syntax and details on how to write smart contracts.

You can start using [Solidity in your browser](https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/) with no need to download or compile anything.

### Environment Dependencies

You need some global environment configurations

- install [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) v8.9.3. We recommend using [nvm and avn to manage the node versions](https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2015/automatic-node.js-version-switching/).

### Project Dependencies

In the project root directory run `npm install` to install all project dependencies

### Running Development Mode

In separate tabs of your console run the following commands:

```
npm run ganache
npm run develop
npm run deploy
```

For more information visit the Truffle Framework documentation.

### Testing your code

We do both static linting and analysis and functional tests.

```
npm run ganache
npm run lint
npm run test
```

### Deploying to the TestNet

We use [Ropsten (revived) Tesnet](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/) as our user testing environment for our contracts.
The deployment is done through [Infura.io](https://infura.io/).
To create Ropsten Wallet Addresses and make use of the Knowledge contracts on the Ropsten TestNet you can use [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) or a command line tool like [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth).

To deploy from your computer first you need create the `.env` file on your machine based on `.env-sample`.
Then run following command:

`npm run deploy-ropsten`

The lastest version of the ERC20 Token on TestNet is `0x0205677f0e7e55ea7789d8e93137513c637e58b3`.
